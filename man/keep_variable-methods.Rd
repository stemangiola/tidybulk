\arguments{
\item{.data}{A `tbl` (with at least three columns for sample, feature and transcript abundance) or `SummarizedExperiment` (more convenient if abstracted to tibble with library(tidySummarizedExperiment))}

\item{.sample}{The name of the sample column}

\item{.transcript}{The name of the transcript/gene column}

\item{.abundance}{The name of the transcript/gene abundance column}

\item{top}{Integer. Number of top transcript to consider}

\item{transform}{A function that will tranform the counts, by default it is log1p for RNA sequencing data, but for avoinding tranformation you can use identity}

\item{log_transform}{DEPRECATED - A boolean, whether the value should be log-transformed (e.g., TRUE for RNA sequencing data)}
}
\value{
A consistent object (to the input) with additional columns for the statistics from the hypothesis test (e.g.,  log fold change, p-value and false discovery rate).

Underlying method:
	s <- rowMeans((x - rowMeans(x)) ^ 2)
o <- order(s, decreasing = TRUE)
x <- x[o[1L:top], , drop = FALSE]
variable_trancripts = rownames(x)

\description{
keep_variable() takes as input A `tbl` (with at least three columns for sample, feature and transcript abundance) or `SummarizedExperiment` (more convenient if abstracted to tibble with library(tidySummarizedExperiment)) and returns a consistent object (to the input) with additional columns for the statistics from the hypothesis test.
