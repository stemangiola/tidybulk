\title{Subset rows using column values}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A tbl. (See dplyr)}

\item{...}{<[`tidy-eval`][dplyr_tidy_eval]> Logical predicates defined in
 terms of the variables in `.data`.
 Multiple conditions are combined with `&`. Only rows where the
 condition evaluates to `TRUE` are kept.
@param .by <tidy-select> Optionally, a selection of columns to group by for just this operation, 
functioning as an alternative to group_by(). 
For details and examples, see ?dplyr_by.}

\item{.preserve}{when `FALSE` (the default), the grouping structure
is recalculated based on the resulting data, otherwise it is kept as is.}
}
\value{
An object of the same type as `.data`.

* Rows are a subset of the input, but appear in the same order.
* Columns are not modified.
* The number of groups may be reduced (if `.preserve` is not `TRUE`).
* Data frame attributes are preserved.
}
\description{
`filter()` retains the rows where the conditions you provide a `TRUE`. Note
that, unlike base subsetting with `[`, rows where the condition evaluates
to `NA` are dropped.
}
\details{
dplyr is not yet smart enough to optimise filtering optimisation
on grouped datasets that don't need grouped calculations. For this reason,
filtering is often considerably faster on [ungroup()]ed data.

* [is.na()]
* [between()], [near()]

\section{Grouped tibbles}{


Because filtering expressions are computed within groups, they may
yield different results on grouped tibbles. This will be the case
as soon as an aggregating, lagging, or ranking function is
involved. Compare this ungrouped filtering:


The former keeps rows with `mass` greater than the global average
whereas the latter keeps rows with `mass` greater than the gender

average.

\section{Methods}{

This function is a **generic**, which means that packages can provide
implementations (methods) for other classes. See the documentation of
individual methods for extra arguments and differences in behaviour.

The following methods are currently available in loaded packages:
