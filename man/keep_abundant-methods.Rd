\arguments{
\item{.data}{A `tbl` or `SummarizedExperiment` object containing transcript/gene abundance data}

\item{.abundance}{The name of the transcript/gene abundance column}

\item{factor_of_interest}{The name of the column containing groups/conditions for filtering. 
Used by edgeR's filterByExpr to define sample groups.}

\item{design}{A design matrix for more complex experimental designs. If provided, 
this is passed to filterByExpr instead of factor_of_interest.}

\item{minimum_counts}{A positive number specifying the minimum counts per million (CPM) threshold
for a transcript to be kept (default = 10)}

\item{minimum_proportion}{A number between 0 and 1 specifying the minimum proportion of samples
that must exceed the minimum_counts threshold (default = 0.7)}

\item{.sample}{The name of the sample column}

\item{.transcript}{The name of the transcript/gene column}
}
\value{
Returns a filtered version of the input object containing only the features that passed
the abundance threshold criteria.

A `SummarizedExperiment` object

A `SummarizedExperiment` object
}
\description{
Filters the data to keep only transcripts/genes that are consistently expressed above 
a threshold across samples. This is a filtering version of identify_abundant() that 
removes low-abundance features instead of just marking them.

\details{
\lifecycle{questioning}


This function uses edgeR's filterByExpr() function to identify and keep consistently expressed features.
A feature is kept if it has CPM > minimum_counts in at least minimum_proportion of samples
in at least one experimental group (defined by factor_of_interest or design).

This function is similar to identify_abundant() but instead of adding an .abundant column,
it filters out the low-abundance features directly.

\examples{
# Basic usage
se_mini |> keep_abundant()

# With custom thresholds
se_mini |> keep_abundant(
  minimum_counts = 5,
  minimum_proportion = 0.5
)

# Using a factor of interest
se_mini |> keep_abundant(factor_of_interest = condition)
